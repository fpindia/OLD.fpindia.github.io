Tech Triveni is Asia's first Functional & Reactive programming and big data conference. It's a unique experience for developers, data scientists, decision-makers and enthusiasts & experts from IT to collaborate on the latest architectures for building and running reactive, big data and functional systems that are scalable, high on performance using the reactive stack. Attendees to TechTriveni 2019 learnt about the latest advances in reactive and functional programming, microservices, streaming data, big data as well as real-world enterprise best practices. </p> </section> </section> </section> <section id="connect" class="sm:h-full justify-center items-center flex flex-col"> <h2 class="w-full sm:text-center text-4xl mb-8 sm:mb-16"> Further ways to connect </h2> <p class="sm:w-2/3 text-xl"> The primary gathering place is this <a href="http://functionalprogramming.in">community website</a> However, we also have our members on these other platforms. The GetTogether community page is currently the primary place to join if you want to attend meetups. Please note that signups on that page do not require any personally identifying information. We also have a Meetup Page, however we are in the process of moving away from Meetup, and the GetTogether page is preferred. We are active in our Telegram Group. Please join that group for informal discussions. It's a welcoming space for folks new to Functional Programming. </p> </section> <section id="resources" class="sm:h-full justify-center items-center flex flex-col mb-4"> <h2 class="w-100 sm:text-center text-4xl mb-8 sm:mb-16"> Resources for functional programming </h2> <p class="sm:w-2/3 text-xl"> This list of resources is curated by the community, and depends on your contributions.
