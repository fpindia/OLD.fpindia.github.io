Tech Triveni is Asia's first Functional & Reactive programming and big data conference. It's a unique experience for developers, data scientists, decision-makers and enthusiasts & experts from IT to collaborate on the latest architectures for building and running reactive, big data and functional systems that are scalable, high on performance using the reactive stack. Attendees to TechTriveni 2019 learnt about the latest advances in reactive and functional programming, microservices, streaming data, big data as well as real-world enterprise best practices. </p> </section> </section> </section> <section id="connect" class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center sm:h-full"> <h2 class="mb-8 sm:mb-16 sm:text-center text-4xl w-full"> Further ways to connect </h2> <p class="sm:w-2/3 text-xl"> The primary gathering place is this <a href="http://functionalprogramming.in">community website</a> However, we also have our members on these other platforms.

There are a lot of functional programming enthusiasts and a lot of new jobs that prefer people with FP experience. However there is a need for a concerted effort to connect the two together. This site is intended to serve that purpose by providing an India and FP focused job board. </p> <p class="sm:w-2/3 text-xl"> &nbsp; </p> <p class="sm:w-2/3 text-xl"> We clearly divide our job posts into the level of FP experience that's desired. This does NOT reflect the seniority level of the job itself. Often companies look for people in senior roles, whop may not yet have significant experience with Functional Programming, but have some demonstrable interest in it. This could mean writing blog posts, having small FP projects on Github, participating in FP communities (like this one!) and attending FP meetups. We especially welcome jobs that involve working with <a href="https://www.simplehaskell.org/">Simple Haskell</a> or other such simple FP in other languages. </p> <p class="sm:w-2/3 text-xl"> &nbsp; </p> <p class="sm:w-2/3 text-xl"> If you would like to post a job here, please email <a href="email:jobboard@functionalprogramming.in">jobboard@functionalprogramming.in</a> with the details. Job postings are completely free, but require that the jobs involve actual functional programming (in any language or platform). You can also mail us if you are looking for a job and would like to be updated when we have jobs that suit your profile. </p> </section> <section id="resources" class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center mb-4 sm:h-full"> <h2 class="mb-8 sm:mb-16 sm:text-center text-4xl w-100"> Resources for functional programming </h2> <p class="sm:w-2/3 text-xl"> This list of resources is curated by the community, and depends on your contributions.
