          We are a community and a meetup group for Functional Programming
          language enthusiasts in India. You can join and participate in the
          online events even if you are somewhere else. We organise regular
          meetups, events, webinars, and workshops, all centered around
          Functional Programming and related technologies. All skill levels from
          novices to gods of category theory are welcome.

            In 2019, FPIndia was a community partner with
            <a href="https://techtriveni.com">Tech Triveni 2.0</a>. Tech Triveni
            is Asia's first Functional & Reactive programming and big data
            conference. It's a unique experience for developers, data
            scientists, decision-makers and enthusiasts & experts from IT to
            collaborate on the latest architectures for building and running
            reactive, big data and functional systems that are scalable, high on
            performance using the reactive stack. Attendees to TechTriveni 2019
            learnt about the latest advances in reactive and functional
            programming, microservices, streaming data, big data as well as
            real-world enterprise best practices.

        The primary gathering place is this

        However, we also have our members on these other platforms. The
        GetTogether community page is currently the primary place to join if you
        want to attend meetups. Please note that signups on that page do not
        require any personally identifying information. We also have a Meetup
        Page, however we are in the process of moving away from Meetup, and the
        GetTogether page is preferred. We are active in our Telegram Group.
        Please join that group for informal discussions. It's a welcoming space
        for folks new to Functional Programming.

        Functional Programming Jobs in India
      </h2>
      <p class="sm:w-2/3 text-xl">
        Functional Programming principles and practices are seeing a renaissance in the Software Industry, and
        that is also true of the Indian software industry. There are a lot of functional programming enthusiasts
        and a lot of new jobs that prefer people with FP experience. However there is a need for a concerted effort to connect the two
        together. This site is intended to serve that purpose by providing an India and FP focused job board.
      </p>
      <p class="sm:w-2/3 text-xl">
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p class="sm:w-2/3 text-xl">
        We clearly divide our job posts into the level of FP experience that's desired. This does NOT reflect the
        seniority level of the job itself. Often companies look for people in senior roles, whop may not yet have significant
        experience with Functional Programming, but have some demonstrable interest in it. This could mean writing blog posts,
        having small FP projects on Github, participating in FP communities (like this one!) and attending FP meetups.
        We especially welcome jobs that involve working with <a href="https://www.simplehaskell.org/">Simple Haskell</a> or other such simple FP in other languages.

      If you would like to post a job here, please email <a href="email:jobboard@functionalprogramming.in">jobboard@functionalprogramming.in</a>
      with the details. Job postings are completely free, but require that the jobs involve actual functional programming (in any language or platform).
      You can also mail us if you are looking for a job and would like to be updated when we have jobs that suit your profile.
